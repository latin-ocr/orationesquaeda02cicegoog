64 says Dr. Middleton, ‘⁸ that he was delivering a speech of thanks, not
only sor himself, but in the name and at the request of the senate,
where his subject naturally required the embellishments of oratory ;
and that all his compliments are grounded on a supposition, that
Caesar intended ιο restore the republic; of which he entertained no
small hopes at this time, as he signifies in a letter to one of Caesar’s
principa] friends. This therefore he recommends, enforces, and re-·
quires from him in his speech, with the spirit of an old Roman3
and no reasonable man will think it strange, that so free an addres-
to a conqueror, in the height of all his power, should want to be
tempered with some few strokes of flattery.’' Of this defence every
one will form his own opinion.

2⁷. G. Marcelli .· The brother of Marcus Marcellus.-

33. Gratulationibus .· In his Cmnmmtarioa, Caesar informs us, that
twenty-five days of congratulation were decreed to him for his suc-
cesses in Gaul, and we are told by Dio, that aster his civil wars sorty
days more were for like purposes decreed to him. But the day here
spoken of says Guthrie, was tc be preferred to any of these ; because
on it he had extended mercy and forgiveness, which are personal
virtues, and cannot, like the glories of war, be shared by others.

42. Victores bellorum civilium.- The victories of Sulla, Marius, Oc-
tavius and Cinna, were succeeded by sanguinat vengeance. ’

65 20. Repudiari .· In a note upon this passage, eromlle says, caem

- was desirous of peace, Cicero advised it, and Pompey reJected it.

It may be a fact that Caesar desired ace, but he desired only the
'peace of slavery, the non-resistance o tame submission to his im-
· ricus mandates; and, although the general conduct of Pompey
ggmonsmted that he was neither a great politician nor an able gen-
eral, yet, with manly indignation, he rejected peace, as a republican
should have done, upon such base conditione.

26. Prudens et sciens....od interitum....voluntarium .· Cicero in this
sentence assigna for the whole reason of his joining Pompey what
was only one of his inducements. He really thou ht that Caesar

litical principle, mfited himse to the Pompeiam party. lint he

ere tells Caesar, that he sided with Pompey stom private, not public
motives, bound by ties of gratitude for the personal favors he had
received from him, 'and that, cool, and consciens of his danger, he

lunged, as it were, into voluntary destruction. This apology might
have been successful3 but it is ιο be regretted, that talenta so great
as those of Cicero confessedly were, should be employed in α, service
so dishonorable as that of flattery and dissimulation.

30. Gum capitis mei periculo .- The following comment has been
made upon these words. Cicero was not present at the battle of ·
Pharsalia, nor was Cato, who staid behind also in the cam at
Dyrrachium, which he commanded with fisteen cohorte, when abi· Λ

 

’ ¹ enus brought them the news of Pompey’s defeat3 ‘u'pon which Cato

, offered the command ιο Cicero, as the superior in dignity ; and, upon l
his refusal of it, as Plutarch tells us, young Pompey was αἴ enraged, 1
that he drew his sword, and would have luned him upon the spot, if
Cato had not prevented it. Though this fact is not mentioned by
Cicero, yet it is probable he refers to it in this passage.

40. Insolentiam certorum hominum.- These were Antony, L. Len-
tulus,L. Domitius AEnobarbus‚ and Curius. The compliments paid ι
ιο Gaesar’s clemency were in part= deserved, as it is probable, that, if l
