the Romans from defeat, and perhaps from destruction. Rome, by
the providential discovery of Catiline’s conspiracy, was lately de·
livered from ruin equally imminent3 and Cicero, no less grateful for
his remarkable deliverance than Tarquin, gave great thanks ιο the
immortal gods, and with great pro riety ιο Jupiter Stator in par-
ticular, the most ancient protector o the city, who had delivered it
from early destruction, and had so latel preserved it from conflagra-
tion, and prevented the assassination o its senate and citizens.

13. In uno homine .- This sentence alludes ιο Catiline’s former at«-
tcm ts ιο raise himself ιο sovereign power.

15. Considi designata: During the interval between the‘eleetion
of consuls and their entrance into office, which was generally six
months, the persons chosen were called consuls elect. Cicero and
Catiline the last year had been rival candidates, and as Cicero suc-
ceeded not only in being elected to the consulship himself, but also
in excluding· Catiline, this assassin had determined to attempt to
murder him in the Campus Martius. , The vigilance of Cicero,
however, defeated his design. The next year, while Cicero was
consul, at the time the Comitia were held, he again employed his
influence in preventing the election os Catiline, w o stood candidate
for the consulship this year also, and Catiline again endeavored to
kin him in the field of election. But the prudence of Cicero and the
exertions of his friends again prevented the execution of his mur·
derous intentioris. See Introduction, . 165.
