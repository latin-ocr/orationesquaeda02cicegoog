31. Legatos-um pedibus .- Phidippus had been in the service of Dei· 79
otarus's deputies, and perhaps in no more honorable a capacity than

11. Nemo emmfere est, eta: This observation rs just, and Cicero

· deserves credit for suggesting it 'to Caesar. When a man is both

34. Qui pro multis soepe dlxisti .· 1 n a note to a former oration (page
77, line 4), we have already observed, that Cesar, in the early part of
his life, applied himself to the business of the bar.

38. Dc accusatorum spe.- That the student may be able to judge
more impartiall of the character of Deiotarus and his accusers, we
will quote an o servation of a judicious commentator. ‘⁴ As to the
facts laid down in this oration, we can say very little ς but, by what
we understand from our author himself in other parts of his writings,
the charges are not so destitute of probability and proof, as he would
represent them. With regard to the characters, the one given of Dei·
otarus, throughout this oration, 1 am apt to believe, is very much mis·
represented3 for, by all other accounts, he appears to have been a
monster of blood and cruelty 3 since he put to death all his own
children, and afterwards Castor-’s own father, which may well ac·
count for Castor's appear-ing in the prosecution.’'

19. Si....eaecusatiom oezacis usus esset .· lt is related that Cresar told 81
Deiotarus, ‘⁴ You are a ve old man 3 Pompey is not to expect, that
you are to take the field3 refore 1 beg you will not go in person,
though, if you please, you may send your troops3 nay, your son at
their head3 ’¹ and that Deiotarus was so inveterate an enemy to Orn-
σέ, stibii} he would not urge even old age as an excuse sor not taking

24. Error-e communi lapsus cst .· Cicero here artfully apologizes for
Deiotarus without offending Caesar, by paying the tribute of flattery,
which in a few lines follows, and by appearing to believe the plausi·
ble excuses Caesar had formed to justify his usurpations. ,

2. In quem ciam Dii atque homines, etc. .· Env and emulation cesse &2
with the life of the person envied and rivalle . An ambitione man,
therefore, will hear without bein offended the praises bestowed upon
a deceased enemy, which, had e enemy been living, would have
induced him to inflict upon the ane-g rist the dictates of the severest
vengeance. The encomium· icero ere pronounces upon Pompey

y attributed to· himself. 'Cicero, therefore, who well knew the ef·
ect of compliments, deserves here more credit for his knowledge of
mankind, than for the freedom of his praises os Pompey.

23. Alexandrinum bellum .- After the battle of Pharsalitt, Coesar im-
mediately set sail for E ypt, to which country Pompey had fied aster
his defeat. Upon his anding, the first news he received informed
him of Pom y’s miserable end. He we t, when he heard the ac·
count, and s ortly aster ordered a magni cent tomb to bc built to
his memor . At this time there were two pretenders to the crown
of Egypt, tolemy, the acknowledged king, and the celebrated Cle·
opatra, his sister. Caesar ordered both oi them to maintain their

retensions before him. Photinus,· the young king’s guardian, dis-
gained accepting this proposal, and sent an army of twenty thou·
