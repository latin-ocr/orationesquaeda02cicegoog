under the tuition of Aulus Lucinius Archias, a native of Antioch,
and a man patronized by men of the greatest eminence in Rome for
his learning, genius, and politeness. His celebrity was so great,
that Lucullus invited him to reside in his family, and gave him the
privilege of opening a school in it, to which many of the young Ro·
man nobility were sent to be educated. The prosperity of this popu·
lar poet and instructor, however, was interrupted by the malignity
os an obscure person, of the name of Gracchus, or by the subornation
of those who persuaded him to acts of enmity against Archias. -Syl-
vanus and Carbo had passed a law, which enacted, that those should
be esteemed Roman citizens, who were admitted to the freedom of

the raetor within sixty days. Upon this law, in the consulship of
Μ. ἓ. Piso and Μ. V. Messala, Gracchus accused Archias3 he 'said
that Archias lived in the city as a citizen, while he was not ent1tled
to the rights of citizenship. He denied that Archias was admitted
to the freedom of any of the confederated cities, that he had an abode
in Italy, at the time the law was passed, and that he had claimed the
privileges of a citizen before the praetor. In this oration, which was
delivered before the praetor, Cicero defends Archias, his friend and
former instructor: he refutes the alle tions of Gracchus, and proves
that Archias was admitted to the reedom of Heraclea and other

however, does not confine imsel to the defencepof Archias‚but, mni
great beaut and elegance, descants upon the raises of poetry iu
general, an upon the talenta and merit of the de endant. Accordin
, ιο Dr. Middleton, Cicero “ expected for his pains an immortality off
fame from the praises of Archias's muse; but, b a contrary fate of
things, instead of deriving any addition of lory rom Archias’s com-

ositions, it is wholly owing to his own, fflat the name of Archias
flas not long ago been buried in oblivion. From the great character
given hy him of the talents and genius of this poet, we cannot help

dates, and was now attempting the consulship of Cicero; but this
nshed with the rest, or, rather, was lest unfimshed, and inter-rupted
yhis death, since we find no further mention of it in Cicero’s later-
wrltmgs.’' At the time of delivering this oration, Cicero was in the
forty·srxth yeffid his age.
