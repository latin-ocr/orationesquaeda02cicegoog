INTRODUCTION.

Tan most remarkable event which happened in the close of the
year οξ Rome 6391, says Dr. Middleton, “ was the pollution ofothe

even pictures of that sort were covered during the ceremony. This
was a proper scene for Clodius’s genius to act upon, an opportunity
of daring beyond what man had ever dared before him; the thought
of mi‘xing the impurity of his lusts with the sanctity of these ven‘-
erable rites flattered his imagination so strongly, that he resolved

him and-his guide, he lost his way, when he came within the house,
