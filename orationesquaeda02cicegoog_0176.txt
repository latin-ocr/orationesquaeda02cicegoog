7 laws, went in an illegal manner, and without any public authority,
into an assembly of the people, who were then electing Grau-,hun
tribune a second time, attached him and his friends, and put him to
death—Pontis& mximas .· It is the opinion of many that Cicero
bere applies to Sci io the title Pontifex Maximus, by anticipation,

· as he immediate] rwards calls him simply a ‘vate person; but
as the Pontifex aximus was not, properly spe ing, a magistrate,
ttlsse term privatus is rightly applied to him in contrast with consules in

25. Servilius Ahala .- In the 3131211 year of Rome, there was a famine
in the city, by means of which, Livy says, a private man was near
obtaining possession of sovereign power. Minucius was appointed
by the senate and people to procure corn in the adjacent countries,
but met with little success„ Spurius Melius, the richest private man
in the commonwealth, had bought up so much os it in the neigh-
boring provinces, that the agent of 'the ublic could not purchase

rovisions of that kind. The corn, which elius had purchased, was
liberally distributed among the peo le; and so great was the popu-
larity he acquired by this artifice an munificence, that a conspiracy
was formed to change the form os government3 Melius aspired to
royalty; the peo le were to take arms in his favor, and the tribunes
consented to sel the public liberty. Upon the discovery of the
conspiracy, T. Q. Cincinnatus was appointed dictator, who, sup-

· posing that nothing but a stroke of authorit could destroy so dan-

rous a plot immediately sent Servilius A ula, his master of the

orse, to cite Melius ρο appear before his tribunal. Melius, surprised,
endeavored to make his escape3 Servilius commanded a lictor to
arrest him. Melius, im loring the assistance of the people, was
rescued by the multituge, and again endeavored to escape3 but
Servilius, pursuing him, overtook him, ran him through the body with
his sword, and thus preserved the liberties of his country.—Novis

8 6. C. rocchus.- Caius Gracchus was a brother of Tiberius Grac-
chus, and, like-him, was a favorite of the people, and opposed to the
Senate. ln the 630th year of Rome, he was chosen tribune, and,
besides manyother acts of po ularity, enforced the execution of his
brother’s Agrarian law, and ad ed to 1t another clause. Marcus Ful-
vius Flaccus was one of the commissioneis appointed to divide the
lands. But, two years afterwards, the consul O imius called an as-
sembly of the people to abrogate that law, and, uring the confusion,
which was common in those meetings, Q. A'ntillius, one of his lictors,
was killed. Opimius excited the senators to execute immediate
ven eance on Gracchus and Fulvius Flaccus, who were supposed to
be e authors of the lictor’s death, but a violent shower of rain
obliged the⁴ parties to separate. On the next day, Gracchus and
Fulvius with their friends were assembled on Mount Aventine3 the
Senate conferred unlimited power on Opimius; the consul imme-
diately attached the partisans of Gracchus, and slew Fulvius, his
sons, anofflghree thousmdd of his followers. Gracchus sought shelter
