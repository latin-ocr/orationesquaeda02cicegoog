Τ. Α. MILO.

4thly, From his hopes of impunity.

And the evidence, upon which these circumstances are alleged,
are the -words and actions of the deceased.

The conclusion of the whole is, Milo acted on sels-defence, and

Clodius was lawsully killed.

ΜΤ.. Novi judicii nova foma: This is called a new trial, because
Milo was not tried by the praetor, as was usual in crimina} cases,
but by a special commission and an extraordinary judge. By nova
sorum he refers to the strong guard, which Pompey brought to the
trial, in order to prevent any violence.

12. Cn. Pompeii, sapientissimi et justissimi viri .· Though Pompey
was not dissatisfied with Clodius’s death, or the manner of it, but

leased, rather, that the republic was freed at any rate from so pesti-
ent a demagogue, et he resolved ιο take the benefit of the occasion
sor getting rid os ilo too, from whose ambition and high spirit he
had reason to apprehend no less trouble. Cicero, bein sensible of
this, as well as the great authority and influence of ompey‚ en·
deavors, through the whole os this oration, to remove the effect:
which they might have upon the minda of the judges.

21. Reliqua,·ctc. .- At this trial there were present three ranks of

selves to procare the condemnation of Milo. The last mentioned con-
sisted of profli ate, low, and abandoned wretcbes, whom Clodius, by
his rapines, baffi gained over to his interest.-

29. Hesterna....conci0ne.· 'rhe da before Cicero pleaded for Milo,
the tribune Munatius Plancus cal ed the people together, and ex·
horted them to appear the next day in a fun body, when ljudgment
was to be iven, and ιο declare their sentimenta in so pub ic a man-
ner, that e accused might not be suffered to escape; which Cicero
reflecte upon as an insuit upon the liberty of the bench.

1. Quid enim nubis duobus, etc. .- Cicero here excites the compassion
of the judges in his own and Milo‘s favor, froma consideration os the
services they had done the state, and the injuries the had received
from the Clodians. Milo might justlyclaim the hi‘g est offices, on
account of his merit; and accordin ly had been ormerly created
tribune, and now stood for the consu ship.

12. T. Annii tribunatu, eto. .· Milo was a tribune the year ati-er
Clodius filled that office, and, during¹ his tribuneship‚ he checked the
seditione of Clodius, and exerted imsclf to procure the recall of
Cicero from exile.

14. Insidias Miloni a Clodio factas .· The great point which
Cicero wishes ιο prove, is, that Clodius waylaid Mum but while he

.demonstrates this, he frequently insinuates, that, if Milo had pre-
meditated the death ‘os Clodius, he would have deserved honors rather
than punish ment, for destroyinfi so desperate and danger-cus an ene-
my to tne peace and liberty of ome.

30. Negant .· The Clodians asserted, that Milo deserved death for
having killed a man. This assertion Cicero refutes by an argument
derived from the examples of former ages of the republic, and from
decisione to the contrary in parallel cases.

33. M. Horatii .· In the 83rd year of Rome, when Tullus Hostilius
was king. there was a war between the Romans and the Albana.
After some success on both sides, and when the two armies were near
each other, the Alban general discovered, that some os the neighbor-
