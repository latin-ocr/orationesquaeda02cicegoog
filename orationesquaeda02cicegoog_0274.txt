ORATION AGAINST

fflsssszssgffich the creonam destroyed Troy. See Virgil’a mnam,-

20. Non solim unum adamsted totamsabulam, confecissem .- 1t has
already been observed, that the authors of Caesar's death were un-

decided in their conduct, aster they had sinin him. Cicero seems ’

here to imply, that it was his opinion, that more should have been
done, besides removing Coesas. This was but one act3 the success
of the drama was not complete 3 there should have been a catas-

trophe, which would have destroyed fection, and reformed the ·

abuses os the constitution os the republic. He seems to insinuate,
that Antony should have been slain.

23. Narbone .· .This was one of the most ancient eities of Gaul, and

ve its name to the province in which it was situated.--Hoc consi·
ἠπι, etc. .· When the conspiratura were consulting about kining Cas-
sar, it was debated among them, whether they should invite Antony
to assist them3 but Trebonius was opposed tu the motion, pretend-

sar was returning from Gaul. He represented, at the same time,
that Antony refused to comply with what he proposed, but that he
had nevertheless kept the secret faithfuny. They then debsted ·
whether they should kill Antony to ther with Coesar ; but Brutus
op d this, because he thought, t t whatever was undertaken in
de ence of liberty and the laws of one’s country, ou ht, if possible,
to be conducted m a popular manner. Thus much P utarch relates3
Cicero, however, affirms, that Antony entered into the design ’ st
Coesar, but that he had not courage to assist in the execution o it.

25. Sewcari .· When the conspirators determined on the manner in
which Coesar should be sinin, they ordered Trebonius to call Antan
aeide, in fear that Antony, who was then consul, and Caesar's co -
league, should exert his consular werto frustrate their design.

35. Ad em, etc. .- Calpurnia, aesar’s wife, aster the death of her
husband, gzd for shelter ιο Antony, carrying with her all the money

ἱ Caesar had lest behind him, amounting to near a million sterling(-

Cujus domus, ete„- Antony had much reason to be pleased with
the death· of Cmsar, as it becanoe the means of his politica} elevation;
b altering the writings, which Caesar lest, foisting into 'them new
c auses, and bribing those who wrote them to write others in the
same hand, he was enabled to govern the republic, dispone of offices,
and gratify his own desires in the same manner as Cesar had done.

4. Castra....Pompeii,eto‚ .· Antony said of Cicero, that, though he

fute; he advised peace, as he foresaw the evil consequences of war,
and of victory, on either side.

25. At vero, eto. .- When Cicero joined Pompey, he was greatly dis·
satisfied with man' thin *in τοίς-πᾶ to his management of the war,
and the conduct o the c iefs o his party, who, trusting to the su-
perior same and authority of their leader, and dazzled with the

ing on the different characters of the two arudes, would hear of
nothing but fighting. Cicero endeavored to discourage this wild
spirit ; 'but findin that his remonstrances were slighted, he resumed
his usual wa o raillery. and what he could not frustrate by his
authority, en eavored to make ndiculous by his jests.
