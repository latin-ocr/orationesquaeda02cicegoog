AGAIN ST CATILINE. 1‘63

ised himself success in his enterprise. These, to the number of about
100,000‚ had been settled in the several colonien and districts of Italy,
in the possession of lands assigned to them b Sulla, which the gen-
erality had since wasted by their vices an luxury; so ‘that they
wanted another civil war to repair their ,shattered fortunes.

About the beginning of June (6139),- in the consulship of L. Caesar
and C. Fi ulus, Catiline began to open his project to his confidants3
to each o them at first alone 3 and having sounded them sufficiently,
so as to rceive their several tempera and dispositione, he called to-
gether a l those who were the most distressed in their affairs, and the
most desperately bold; fudgil‘lng it now advisable to speak to them in
a body. In this assemb y, ere were of senatorian rank, P. Cornelius
Lentulus Sura, P. Autronius, L. Cassius Longinus, C. Cethegus, P.
Sulla and S. Sulla (the sons of Servius Sulla), L. Vargunteius, Q.
Annius, M. Porcius Laeoa, L. Bestia, and Q. Curius3 of the eques-
trian order, M. Fulvius Nobilior, L. Statilius, P. Gabinius Capito,
and C. Cornelius.

Lentulus was descended from a patrician branch of the Cornelian
family, one of the most numerous, as well as the most splendid in
Rome. His grandfather had borne the title of “ Prince of the Senate,”
and was the most active in the pursuit and destruction of C. Grac-
chus, in which he received a dangerous wound. The grandson,by the
favor of his noble birth, had been advanced to the consulship about
eight years before, but was turned out of the senate soon aster by the
censors, for the notorious infamy of his lise, till, by obtaining the prae·
torship a second time, which he now actually enjoyed, he recovered
his former place and rank in that supreme councrl. His parts were
but moderate„or rather slow; et the comeliness of his person, the
gracesulness and propriety o {iis action, the strength and sweet·
ness of his voice, procured him some reputation as a speaker. He
was lazy. luxurious, and profligately wicked; yet so vain and ambi-
tious,as to expect, from the overthrow of the government, to be the
first manin the republic; in which fancy he was strongly flattered
by some crasty soothsayers, who assured him, from the Sibyllino
books, that there were three Cornelius’s destined to the dominion of
Rome3 that Cinna and Sulla had alreadzvpossessed it, and the proph-

centina, and hoping to reap the clue fruit from its success.

Cethegus, of an extraction equally noble (being of the Cornelian
family), was of a· temper fierce, impetuous, and daring, to a degree
even of fury. He had been warml engaged in the cause of Marius,
with whom he was driven out o Rome3 but when Sulla’s affairs
became prosperous, he presently changed sides, and thr-owing him-
self at Sulla’s feet, and promising great services, was restored to the
city. After Sulla‘s death, by intrigues and faction, he acquired so
great an influence, that, while Pompey was abroad, he governed all
thin at home3 procured for Antonius the command over the coast
of t e Mediterranean, and for Lucullus the man ement of the
Mithridatic war. · In the height of this power, he ma e an excursion
into Spain, to raise 'contributione in that province, where, meeting
with some opposition to his violences, he had the hardiness to insult,
and even wound the proconsul Q. Metellus Plus. But the insolence of
his conduct, and the infamy of his life, graduall diminished, and at
last destroyed, his credit3 when, finding himse 5 controlled by the
