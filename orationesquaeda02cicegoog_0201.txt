THE ORATION FOR THE MANILIAN LAW.

 

mrsouucnos.

'l'ms celebrated oration, the first 'which Cicero delivered from the
Rostra, was pronounced in the 687th ye'ar of Ro'me, in the 41st ear
of the orator’s age, and three years before the orations against ati·
line. The Romans at that tune were engaged in war with Mithri-
dates, ki of Pontus. This monarch, able, ambitious, warlike, and
a second annibal in military talents, as well as in hatred to the Ro-
mans, disdained to submit to the commands of the Roman commis-
sioners in Asia, which checked his enterprises, and, in cool blood,
ordered eight thousand Roman citizens to be massacred in one da .
Sulla, and, ager him, Lucullus, had been sent against this powe ul

peace with Mithridates, and give him an opportunity to retrieve his
affairs, and make more vigorous opposition in future. Lucullus prob-
ably would have sulgugated him, had not a mutiny in ⁴the Roman
army existed, and ha not the general's ersonal enemies in Rome
persuaded the senate to recall him. T ese unfortunate incidente

enabled Mithridates to become master of the field; the Roman army ’

was dissipated3 the Roman neral was removed; Glabrio, the con-
sul, who was sent to succee Lucullus, was a man of inferior talents.
At this time, Manilius, one of the tribunes, proposed a law that
Pompey, who was then in Cilicia terminating the piratic war, should
have the government of Asia added to his commission, with the com· „
mand of the Mithridatio ‚war, and of all the Roman armies in those
parts. This law was much opposed by the senate, who were unwill- .
ing to confer so extensive authorit upon any individual, but was so
acceptable to the peo le, of whom om y was a great favorite, that
none but Catulus and² Hortensius, who {read both passed through the
consulship, dared to s ak 'nst it. It was defended by Servilius
Isauricus and Caesar3 icero so, at that time praetor, most eloquent·
ly advocated it in this oration.
