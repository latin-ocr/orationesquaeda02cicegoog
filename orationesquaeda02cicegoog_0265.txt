the sixth of August, in continuing his voyage to Greece, some cir-
cumstances obliged him to put back3 and when he reentered the city,
he met some citizens just arrived from Rome, who brou ht a report,
that a suu meeting οἱζ the-senate was expected on the rst of Sep-
tember3 that Brutus and Cassius had sent circular letters requesting
the attendance· of all their friends3 that Anton was likely to drop
his designs 3 that, as the cause of the republic · ad so favorable an

ports, he determined to return to Rome ; and, having arrived on the
ast os August, he ‘found that the expectatione, which he had been
made to entertain of Antony’s intentioris, were void os foundation,
and that tbe outra s he was likely to commit were such as to make
it extremely unani& for any distinguished friend of the republic to
come into his power. For this reason, Cicero, on the first of Sep·

tember, sent an excuse to the senate, ’pleading the-ill state of his ·

health, which obliged him to remain in his own house. Antony
v considered his absence from the senate as an affront ιο himself, or as

giym too rnuch countenance to the suspicions which were enter-
taine of his molent intentione. Under this impression, he ‘burst

famous oration, which fs entit’leil the Second Philippic‚ “ a model οῗ

tive3 ” but which, though put in the form of an immediate reply to
imputatione supposed to be made in his presence, never was deliver-

titious case. The offence, however, which was given by the publi·
cation of this invective, made a principal part in the quarrel, which
the parties never ceased to pur-sue till it ended with Cicero’s lise.
These orations were called Philippica, in imitation of the famous ora-
