p m. lgm· proetor· primm .· Comitia for electing ‘sti-ates and enact-
⁸ laws were osten dissolved by some pemn’s ta ' the auspices,
aeffich deferred the meeting to another day. This was an expedient
osten used by those public officers, who were opposed to a successful
candidate or a popular law, to prevent the passing of the one or the
election of the other. In the year in which Cicero· offered himself
candidate sor the praetorship, by the promul ation of several laws, to
which the senate were much oppose ‚ the omitia were so osten dis-
uolved, it was feared there would be no election. These disturb-
ances, however, were the occasion of an unexpected honor to Cicero ,
in the three different assemblies convened for the choice of raetors,
two of which were dissolved without effect, he was declare every
time the first proetor by the suffrages of all the centuries.—Centurizs
cuais .- The praetors were chosen by the Comitia centuriata, as were
also the consuls and censors3 inferior magistrates were chosen by the
Comitia tributa .- in the last-mentioned assemblies, the majority of the
· votes in each tribe determined the general vote of the tribe, and a
majority of tribes determined the election, in which the meanest citi·
-zen, therefore, had as much influence as the most powerfiil3 but in
the Comitia centuriata, instituted by kin Servius Tullius, the balance
of the power was put into the hands o the affluent and noble. All
the citizens were divided into 193 centuries, according to a valun-
tion of their estates, and these centuries were, according to the same
rule, reduced into six classes3 the first and richest class consisted of
ninety-seven centuries, a majorit of the whole number. If, there·
fore, the centuries of the first c ass agreed, the affair was decided ;
the votes of the rest were of little importance.
44 7. Mithridate ct Tigrane .· Mithridates is considered by Plutarch
“ (in Iawullo) as a king, in oint of talents, second only to Alexander
the Great. He had expelled Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, and Ario-
barzanes, king of Cappadocia, from their res ctive kin doms3 and,
by the extent of his territories and the num r of his liances, be-
came one of the most owerful enemies ever opposed to Rome. At
the beginning of the ithridatic war, in which Tigranes also, kin
of Armenia, became involved, that prince was the most powers:

general demanded him of that king, and threatened war in case of
refusal. Tigranes refiised, and soon aster was defeated and dispos-
sessed of his capital, Tigranocerta. Provoked by his loss, he made
eat exertions to retrieve his affairs, and, in consequence of the un-
ortunate sedition in the Roman camp, and of the recall of Lucullus,
ravaged Cappadocia, and was carrying his depredations into other
rovinces. -
Ρ 9. Equitibus Romanis.- The Roman revenues were fai-med by the
knights, who were divided into several societies for this purpose. 1 n
Rome these farmers of the revenue were in much respect, but in the
provinces they were osten deservedly dete-ted.
