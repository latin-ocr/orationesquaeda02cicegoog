lected a large library‚ which was open to all men of learning.

⁷. Proetezt dus.- The toga proetezta was given to young men about

Of the Luculli we have already spoken. Drusus was an uncle of
Marcus Cato, was a tribune of the people, and was slain at home in
the beginning of the social war. There were three Octavii in Rome 3

22. Hemonam-⁰ Heraclea was an Italian city, situated upon the
borders of Campania, near Rhegium and Tarentum. It was one of
the associate- cities, whose citizens had the same privile s that the
Romans had. Archias of course, therefore, might claim e privileges
of a Roman citizen.

Pyrrhus was in Ital , in the year of Rome 4⁷5.

of unquestiona le integrity. -

12. Appii tabula, stc. .- Appius and Gabinius were roetors when
Archias was registered. The register of Appius was nowu to be
kept negligently ; and the corruption of Gabinius, while he was saie,
and his disgrace, aster his condemnafion, destroyed the credit of his
register also. This Gabinius was afterwards consul with L. Piso ;
it does not appear of what crime he had been convicted.

privileges of a citizen.
