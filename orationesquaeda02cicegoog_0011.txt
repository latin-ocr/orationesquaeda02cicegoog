Tm: Second Edition of this book having been revised by the Editor

of 'the present, in the year 1811, under the direction and with the assist-
ance of the respected head of the institution for the use of which it
was originally prepared, and having obtained the reputation of an ac-

· curate classical school-book, it was with regret that those who felt a

personal concern. in that edition, saw a third and surreptitious one make
its appearance, deformed with the grossest errors, and, by the absence of
all intelligent care, doing discredit to the classical school with the name
of which it was associated.

At the instance, therefore, of his venerated friend, Dr. Abbot, the
Editor undertook to publish a Fourth Edition, which should be less un-
worthy of the Roman orator, and of that seat of liberal discipline, so
fondly remembered by so many of the friends of good learning in the

to be spurious, or are rendered doubtful by being variously written in
different MSS„ or for some other reason are a subject of disagreement
among critics. No change has been made in this text, except in con-
forming the 'orthography of certain words to that of the dictionaries and
grammars in common use in this country, and distinguishing by accents
certain equivocal words. The lines have been numbered in the margin,
as well for the sake of disencumbering the body of the text of figures re-
ferring to the notes, as for the convenience of the instructer in exercising
his pupils in grammatical analysis.

The N otes,· according to the good usage which now prevails in books of
this sort, have been placed by themselves at the end of the volume, that
they may be consulted only when needed, in learning a lesson, and not
when the pupil should rely on his memory, in reciting it. Some of the
explanatory notes were rendered unnecessary by the improved state of
the text, and these have been omitted; some that were wrong have
been expunged or altered ; and notwithstanding the faults of matter or
