MAN ILIAN LAW. 209

42. Ne legaretur A. Gabinius .- It is said by Roman historiam, that 57
the only motive, which induced Gabinius to publish his law in favor
of Pompey, was the desire of being chosen one of his lieutenants.
Pompey solicited this, but the people refused it ; and, although Cicero
here says, that this refusal appeared to him a great indignity, we
must doubt con‘cerning his sincerit , since, in another oration (Post
Reditum in Senatu), he Ἥ, that abinius was so necessitous and so
rofligate at this nme, t, if he hed not passed this law, he must
ve turned pirate himself.

{hese circumstances, it was customary to advance the tribunes to the

'eutenancies. ’

16. Proeter intercessionem .- It was in the power of any tribune to
stop the proceedings of any assembly of the people by his intercession,
that is, by pronouncing the solemn word Veto.

19. Unus A. Gabinius....cmms Gn. Pompeio.- It has been said, we
must „not believe Cicero sincere in all the opinions he advances in
his orations3 he was so much of a statesman and lawyer, as some-
times, fora (politic purpose, or a client's 'advan , to express a belief
which he di not entertain. See Note,page 57, 'ne 42, and the last
note to this oration. . .

42. Scipione. ..Mario : Cicero here apolo ‘zes for the unusual au·
thority conferred on Pompey, by the exam es of Scipio and Marius.
Scipio AEmilianus was twice elected cons at an illegal age, and in
his consulships destroyed Carthage in Astica,and Numantia in Spain.
Marius was elected seven times consul, which electione were un·

pgecedented. He conquered ,Iugum-tha, the Cimbri, and the Teu-
nes.

9. A senatorio gradum lon ὲ abesset.- Itis said b Dr Alexan· 59
der Adam, that in the time of icer0, the usual age o bein ehosen
a senator seems to have been thirty-one5 of Pompey,Plutarc relates,
that he could have been received into the senate before that age, but
that he refused it; his vain-glory induced him to think it a greater
honor to triumph, while he was onl k ⁰ ht.

14. Triumphum .·, It is related, at w en Pompey had defeated

Domitius AEnobarbus and Hiarbas, king of one of Numidia, and
returned to Rome, he demanded a. triumph of ulla, at that time dic-
tator. Being refused, he said it would be best for Sulla to consider,
‘⁴ that the rismg had more worshippers than the setting sun.” Sulla
did not hear thrs3 but being told of it, he was struck with the bold·
ness of the expression, and instantly said, ‘⁴ Let him triumph, let him
ωέᾆῃρῗῶωτη .· Pompey had a second triumph, for his victory over the
remains of Sertonus’s army.

10. Servilius.- After-the defeat of the praetor Antonius, P. Servilius 61
