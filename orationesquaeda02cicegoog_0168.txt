of bribery and corruption by the Calpurnian Law, and being brought
to trial, and found guilty before their entrance into office, their ac-
cuser· and competitors, L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius
Cotta, were proclaimed consuls elect. Some little time aiter this,
Catiline, who, on the expiration of his proetorshi , had obtained the

revince of Africa, came to Rome to sue sor t e consulship; but,

ing accused of extortion and rapine in that government, was not
permitted to pursue his pretensions.

At this time, Cn. Piso, a young nobleman‚ extremely bold, indi-
gent, and factious, was instigated, by his poverty and depraved
morals, to raisc disturbances in the state3 with him Catiline and
Autronius entered into a combination about the fisth of December ιο
assassinate the consuls Torquatus and Cotta, in the Capitol, on the
first of January3 which done, Autronius and Catiline' were to seize
the consulship and send Piso with an army to take possession of
both Spains. fiat, their object somehow getting air, they deferred
,the intended assassination to the 5th of February ; at which time they

had been perpetrated the most wicked deed that Rome had ever be-
held since the foundation of the city.

Not long aster this disappointment, Catiline was brought to trial
for his o pressions in Africa. of his guilt nobody doubted3 but,
throu h the iniquity of his jud s, he was acquitted·.

An the very next· year (ὃὲξ), when Cicero was a candidate, in
form, for the consulship, Catiline, being then free, stood against
him for the same dignity. But the rumor of a dreadful plot, read
to break out, produced a disposition universally to confer the consuf-
ship on Cicero, whose abihties were well known. This plot was
the famous conspiracy of Catiline.

Sallust, after relating the universal prevalence, at Rome, of those
vices that are the ruin of states, rapacious covetousness, shameless
venality, and boundless luxury, adds, that Catiline had collected,
which m such a city it was not difficult to do, a band of needy prof-
ligates, who attended him as guards ιο his person; that he had
been very assiduous in seekin intimacies with young persons chiefly,
whose minds, being sost an pliable, were easily moulded to what
fashion he pleased ; and that he spared no eost ιο gratify the favorite
