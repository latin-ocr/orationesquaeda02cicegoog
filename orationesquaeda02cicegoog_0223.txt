M. MARCELLUS. 21⁷

Pompey’s party had succeeded, victory and its consequences 'would 65
have been more bloody.

5. Alterius....partis: The party of Pom y and the senate. 66

l15. Excellenta bono .· By these words icero means Coesar's great
c emenc . .

ᾗ. oginionc....stultdfortassc: It would have been better to omit
the word stulta. Caesar might have been raised for his clemency,
without hearing the republican opinions o his antagonist degraded
by the appellation of sotly. '

32. ραενοίατη....εηερίοἰοποπι .· Caesar, as has been before mention·
ed, suspected that Marcellus still harbored evil designs against him.

18. Omnia, etc. .· Cicero here advises Caesar to restore the repub· 67
lic, and correct the abuses of its constitution3 and such was his ad-
dress, that the advice was not displeasing to the despot3 but it was
improbable that an usurpet so ambitious of power as was Coesar,
should observe counsels so contrary to the desi ns for the comple-
tion of which he had fought and slain above a mifiion of men.

30. Illam....voccm....satis diu....m’xi.· Astel- having complained of
the animosity of MarcelluS, Caesar said, that he himself had lived
long enough for either nature or glory. At this time he was in the
fist -fourth year of his age. ·
d gli Doctorum hominum .- The Stoios, who pretended to despiss

eat .
36. Grebrd dicero .- Suetonius relates, that Caesar had in reality
iven some of his friends reason to believe, that he did not wish to

five longer, and that he did not regret the ill state of his health.

⁷. Vide, quoeso, ns tua divina virtus, etc„- Cicero here deserves 68
eredit for his address, and the freedom of his caution.

27. Nunc, otiam quoe laudet, exspectat ε The free-dom of this remark
also is to· be commended. Caesar was, without doubt, a man of great
abilities 3 posterity will long admire his talents; but, as Cicero tells,
him, it ought to see somethmg it can commend as well as admire.
Insatiable ambition and goodness are seldom companions.

28. Imperia, provincias, etc. .· Caesar had commanded an army in
Gaul, Britain, Germany and Africa. Spain, after his praetorship,-
and Gaul aster his consulship, were the provinces assigned to him.
He first built a brid over the Rhine, over which he passed his army,
and conquered the germana He first commanded a fleet in the At-
lantic ocean, b which he carried his army into Great Britain. He
conquered Ptoi'emy, kin of Ε ypt, a countr annuall overflowed
by the river Nile. For t e num er of his batt es, see ote, 'page 63,
line 20. Monuments and statues were erected to him aster his civ-
il wars, and honors were paid to him as to a god. As was usual
after victories, he had given many presents to his soldiers, and had
also entertained the people with feasts, theatrica] exhibitions, διο.
He had trium hed five times. “ But, notwithstanding all these
things‚’' says icero, who appears in this part of the oration with
that dignity which he always should have possessed when addressin
Coesar, “ notwithstanding all these, your fame may be spread throug
the world, but it will never be stable, unless you strengthen this city
b your counseIS, and guard it by your laws. ' For this passage, and
die succeeding remarks, Cicero deserves great credit.

42. Ut quidamsalsd ¹putant .· Cicero here expresses his belief os the
immortality of the sou .

· 7. Vicit is, qui, etc. .- The moderation and clemency of Coesar ap· ω
peared greaterlfgom contrast, as Pompey, who, during the civil war,
