THE ORATION FOR KING DEIOTARUS.

 

INTRODUCTION.

Or the facts relative to this oration, we can learn but little from his-
torians; even the character os Deiotarus seems not to be ascertained
with accuracy3 he is represented by some as amiable and virtuous,
by others as sanguinary and cruel. An incident, which has perhaps
pre vented the facts concerning the subject of this oration from being
more fully and correctly known, is, that it was not delivered in the
Forum, but privately before Coesar in a dwelling-house. What we
are able to learn is, that king Deiotarus was Te arch of Gallogroecia3
that, during the civil wars between Coesar an Pompey, he assisted
· the latter3 that, aster the battle of Pharsalia he abandoned his party3
that, aster having been stripped of gart of* his dominicus, to atone
for his offence, he was pardoned by oesar3 that, during the wars m
the East, he entertained Coesar as his guest in the cast-le of Luceiusz
