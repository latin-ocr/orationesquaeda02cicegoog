Armenians, Gordyaemans, Medes, Adiabenians, led by their kin ;
Arabiane from the 'country between. Bab lon and the Persian gu ;
Albanians and Iberians from the coasts ο the Caspian sea3 and seve-
ral free nations and' Nomades (Tartars) from the nei hborhood of the

Lucullus intended to continue his march to Artaxata, the rmer cap-
ital of Armenia, but, as it was distant many days' march to the north,

assisted Ti anes, gave assistance also to Mithridates, who at this

whom Lucullus had left there, and afterwards routed the army of the
rash lieutenant, Triarius. .

33. Nostram calamitatem: It was the rashness of Triarius, which
caused this calamity. ·Flattered by the prospect of the glory he

with the king ο Pontus, an .was so totally defcate , that not one of
his army would have esca d, had not Mithridates received a wound,
which induced his gener s to check the pursuit. This was the most
severe defeat which, the Romans experienced in all their wars against
Mithridaten seven thousand Romans remained dead upon the field
of battle. “ Cicero,'' says a celebrated Roman historian, “ was in·
duced to say, that the Roman general received only from public ru·
