Τ. A. MILO. 247

‚, of the senate, because the murder of Clodius was committed in self- 102

defence, to which every man had a natural right.

4. Ambusti tribuni plebis .· The epithet ambusti was applied to Mu· 103
natius PlancuS‚ because he instigated and assisted the people ιο burn
the court, and the desks, seats, tables, and books in the Forum.—In
ter-mortue conciones .- These short-lived harangues, by asserting that
the senate was under the control of Cicero, implied, that the senate
decreed nothing against Mi103 which contradiction to the assertione
of the other enemies of Milo, Cicero here notices.

13. Hanc questionem .· “ This extraordinary trial.’'

17. Incesta stupro .· The word incestus was used by the Romans in
relation not only to a kinswoman, but also to a vestal virgin, or any
female immediate] employed in performing the rites and ceremo-
nies of religion. lt ὶι therefore properly applied to Clodius in rela-
tion to Caesar’s wife, while she was engaged in celebrating the mys-
teries of Bona Dea. ’

bunes, supported by all the Clodian fection, would, not permit the
law to be offered ιο the suffrages of the citizens. The affair being
likely to produce· great disorders, Hortensius proposed an expedient
which was accepted by both arties, that the tribune Fusius should

ublish a law for the trial o Clodius by the praetor, with a select

nch of ‘udges. The consequence was, that by bribery a majority

ottttilhe judgets were induced ιο aequit Clodius, and he thus escaped
wi lm uni .

29. Agpia :y Via understood. Cicero here artfully insinuates, that,
though the senate had found the fray upon the Appian Way ιο be
an act of treason against the commonwealth‚ yet that Milo could
never be affected by that decree, because, sa s he, it was the vio-
lence, that constituted the treason. Now lodius, the aggressor,
was the author of the violence, and not Milo,to whom the principles
os sels-defence, without an regard to the consequences, gave a
right ιο preserve his own li e.

32. Qudd si, etc. .· Had not the senate been controlled by the tri-
bune Munatius Plancus, they would have decreed, that Milo should
be trigd in the usual form, and he probably would have been ac-

uitte .

q 36. Divisa sententia.- When any opinion„ proposed to the senate,
was thought too neral, and to include several distinct articles
some of which mig t be approved, and others rejected, it was usual
to require that it might be divided. This was the caue with the
first decree relative to the death of Clodius3 it contained three dis- ’
tinct charge-3 it declared that the death of Clodius, the burning of
the court, and the attach upon Lepidus's house, were acts hostile to
the commonwealth. Neither party would agree ιο this decree en·
tirely; the enemies of Milo therefore obtained a new decree, that
there should be a special trial of the author of Clodius’s death.

36. Postulante nescio quo.- This was Q. Fusius, a senator, whom
Munatius Plancus had corrupted by bribery. Cicero does not name
him, because he was in the senate. , .

44. Qudd nisi vidisset, ete. .- Cicero well knew of what great au-
thority Pompey's opinion would be in this trial. He therefore, with-
