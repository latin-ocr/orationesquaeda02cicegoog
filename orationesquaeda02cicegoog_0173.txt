No sooner was the meeting over, than Cicero had information of
all that passed in it3 for Curius sent Fulvia to him, with a punctus]
account of their deliberations. He presently imparted his intelli·
gence to some of the* chiefs of the city, who were assembled that
evening, as usual, at bis house, informing them not only of the de-
