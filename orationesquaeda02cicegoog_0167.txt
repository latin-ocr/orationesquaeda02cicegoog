THE FIRST ORATION AGAINST CATILINE.

INTRonUcTION.

Lucms Sancum eumn, of an illu-tricus famil from which
consuls and military tribunes with consular power ha freffluentl
been taken to govern the state), was a man of singular stren ‚ bo
of body and mind, but of a disposition extremely vicious. e had a
head to contrive‚ a tongue to rsuade, and a hand to execute the har·
diest attempt. From h1s youtffi , he took pleasure in civil broils, civil
wars, rapine, and massacres. e was wonderfully constituted for
enduring cold, hun er, and want of rest3 of a spirit daring and insidi-
ous 3 expert in all the arts of disguise and dissimulation ; greedily cove-
tous of other men’s wealth, lavish of his own; violent in his passions,
eloquent enough, but not endowed with much wisdom. His bound-

the wicked nuptiale. “ And tbi-,⁹¹ says the historiari, ‘⁴ in my opinion,
was what hurried him to the execution of his atrocious enterprise.
For his polluted soul, full of rage against both gods and men, could find
no rest either waking or sleeping, so incessantly did a guilty con·
science torment him! Hence his sace was pale, his counienanfl'e
ghastly, his gait and motion unequal‚ now uick, then slow; in a
word, his appearance was that of a man out o his senses.

He had probabi been· quaestor in the year 676, οι· 677, and, aster
the expiration o his quaestorship, lieutenant to Scribonius Curio,
proconsul of Macedon, Anno Urbis 678; and he was praetor at Rome
