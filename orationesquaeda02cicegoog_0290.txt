’ As 1 looked over the “ Praetical Elocutionist” of Mr. Maglathlin‚ 1

found my old Whateleian pre‘udices against rules for utterance vanish.
The practical, intelli ible, and valuahle nature of the rules in this little

book makes it the on y thin 1 have ever seen which 1 thought would .

hel eitpler tencher or scho ar in our common schools in learning to

From Levi Rud, Principalfff the Washington Sahal, Ros-bury, Mass„
and Fre-udam qf tlte orfolk County Tzacher? assemanum.

. 1 have examined ‘⁸ The Praetical Elocutionist ” with much satisfac·

tion, and am happ to say that 1 like its plan and matter. A brief
manual of vocal cu ture, like this, has been much needed, and 1 have
no doubt, that, in the hands of a skilful toacher, it may be used with
the happiest results.

rose Academy, near Boston, Mass.

“The Praetical Elocutionist” js, as it should be, brief ; but bei ‚
throughout, definite, lucid, and thoroughly praefical, it is abundant y
full and comprehensive. It seems to us exactly ada ted to supply our

ublic schools and. academies with what man excel ent tenchers have
Bitherto regarded ns a great desideratum. aving introduced it into
the institution under our char ‚ and had opportunity to test its merite

gytastual use, we are prepare to give the work our highest commen·
