truth obliged him to testify, Clodius from that time became his im-
lacable enemy. He not only procured the banishment of Cicero,
gut extended his resentment to deeds of malice against the friends
of the orator. Os these friends Milo was one, and consequently
was often persecuted by Clodius. It afterwards happened, in the
'701st year os Rome, when Milo, with two powerful competitore, was
a candidate for the consulship, that Clodius was a candidate for the
praetorship; and so great was their enmity, that each, by all the
means in his power, endeavored to prevent the success of the other.‘
The senate and all the virtuous art of the community were in fa·
vor os Milo, but the intrigues ο the Clodian fection prevented the
election of consuls for a long time aster its usual period.

At this time, says Asconius, Milo endeavored to procure a meet-
ing of the Comitia as soon as possible, and was upon the point of
succeeding; for he had not onl the good wishes of all virtuous
men, who opposed Clodius, but likewise of the populace itself, who
caressed him on account of his largesses, and his great ea nse in
entertainin them with plays and shows of gladiators. But is com-

of the Calends of February, Milo went to Lanuvium (of which he
was a citizen, and, at that time, dictator) in order to create a priest
on the next day3 and that Clodius, in his return stom Aricia, met
him, about three in the asternoon, a little on the other side of Bovillae,
and nigh the place where the temple of Bona Dea stood. Clodius
was on horseback3 his retinue consisted of about thirty slaves with
swords, and every way prepared for an attack‚ which was the usual
way of travelling in those days. Besides these, Clodius had three

to the eq’uestrian order. Milo was in a chariot together with his
wife Fausta, and Marcus Fusius, his intimate acquaintance. He was
attended by a great number of servants, some of them gladiatore,
and two of them, Eudamus and Birria, famous in their profession3
who, walking slowl in the rear, hap ned to enter into a quan-el
with the servants ο Clodius. As Clo ius turned about, with a stern
and menacing air, to behold the fray, Birria run him through the
shoulder with a sword. The riot increasing, Milo's servants ran up
to the assistance of their companions‚ and Clodius, beina wounded,
was cairied into a tavern near Bojvilloe. Milo, hearing diat Clodius
was wounded, and thinkin · that it might rove danger-ons, if he
should live to resent it, but t iat his death wou d give him great satis-
faction, even though he should be punished for nt, ordered the tav-
ern to be broken open. Marcus Fustenus was the leader of Milo’s
servants, and Clodius, attemptin to conceal himself, was dra ged
forth, and killed with repeated sta s. His body was lest on the ingh
way, because his servants were either slain. or, being wounded, took
care to conceal themselves. Sextus Tedius, a senator, as he hap-
pened to return from the countr , took it up, and ordered it to be
carried to Rome. The bod reac ed Rome before the first honr of
