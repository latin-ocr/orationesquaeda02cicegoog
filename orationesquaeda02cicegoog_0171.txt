AGAIN 8:1¹ CATILINE. · 165

ρτοωεέἥιιὶς his inffirest at the approaching election‚ ond then dis-
nufge thisechsrlfigilragy was Q. Curius, a man of no mean funilg, but
who, for his scande-leus conduct, had been expelled the senate the
censors. Des rately audacious he was, yet had not more bol ness
than levity3 or whatever he heard he disclosed3 he could not con-
ceal even his own crimes3 in a word, he considered neither what he
said, nor what he did. There had been sor a long time, a criminul
intercourse between him md Fulvia, a lad of quality. He had ruin-
ed his fortune by the excesu of his libernffty to her; and so soon ps
she perceived that he was poor, he found himself despised. Impa-
tient under this disgnoe‚ he began now to talk big, md to boast of
mountains of gold, which he should soon be master of ; and, some-
times, instead of the humble suitor, the submissive lover, he put on
the fierce tyrant. This change of style made her curious to know
the ound of it. She very soon t the secret out of him3 and
whe er she made small account of e promises of a ruined lover, or
had no opinion of an enterprise managed by debauchees‚ and giddy,
thoughtless oung men, or had too much of common humanity to

The rumor of the impending danger being thus spread, the centu·
ries with one voice proclaimed M. Tullius Cicero the first consul
(giving him C. Antonius for a colleague„ ⁴a heavy blow, which very*
much shocked the generality of the conspirator-s. Catiline’s fury,
however, abated not m the least3 he exerted himself every day more
and more; provided magazines of arms in ull the most commodious

lius, a bold and experienced centurion, whss, having ehrolled a con-
siderable body of men, waited only his orders to take the field.
Catiline, notwithstanding these mensures taken for war, declared
himself a. candidate for the next year's consulshi 3 md renewed hie
efforts with greater vi r than ever to obtain it ; hoping, if he should
be chosen, to vern ntonius ns he pleased. He pursued his pre·
tension by suc open methods of bribery, that Cicero published a new
law against it, with the additional penalty of a ten years’ exile, pro-

Catiline, who knew the law to be levelled at him principnlly‚ formed
a desi to kill Cicero, with some other chiefs of the senate, on the
day o election; but Cicero gave information of it to the senate the
day before, u on which the election was desen-ed, that they might
have time to liberate on an affair of so great im rtnnoe3 und the

told them that “ there were two bodies in the republic (meanin tho
senate and the peo le), ‘⁴ the one of them infirm with a weak ead
the other firm wi out a heau which last had so well deserved 01²
him, that it should never want a head while he lived.” He had
made a declaration of the same kind, and in the same ploce, a few
days before, when, upon Cato’s threatening him with un impeach·
