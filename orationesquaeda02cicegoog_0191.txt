she sought the sameyprice for the remaining six. Refuse again, she,
went and burnt other three, and, coming back, still demanded the same
price for the three which remained. Tarquin, sur rised at the strange

The woman, having delivered them, and received her price, desired
them to be carefiill kept, then suddenl disappeared, and was never
asterwards seen. he books were foun to be the eracles of the Sibyl

Cornelius Cinna, a man rash in counsel, but resolute in action, was
raised to the consulship, and had no sooner entered upon his office,

himsel master o Rome, murdered the friends of Sulla, who was con·
ducting the war in Asia against Mithridates, and whom he declared
banished from the city, and, for three successive years, usurped the
consulship, and associated with himself whom he pleased as col-
leagues. At the expiration of these years, Sulla made a ace with
Mithridates, and came toward Rome; and such were e number
and importance of his victories, the splendor and riches of his army,
and the greatness of his wer, that when Cinna had raised troops
