see a shining breast-plate, which he wore under it3 a precautlon
which, deeply im rinting on the multitude a sense of the common
danger, revente , as he told Catiline asterwards to his face, his
design o killing, not only him, but D. Junius Silanus, and L. Licinius
Murena, who were declared consuls elect. -

Catiline, thus a second time repulsed, and breathing nothing but
revenge, was now eager and impatient to executa his grand plot.

With this view he despatched C. Manlius, then at Rome, ιο Fesulae, '

and the ad'acent parts of Etruria3 Septimius to the territory of Pice-
num3 C. ulius into Apulia; and others to different places, where he
thought they mi ht be most serviceable to his design. At the same
time, he was busi y employed in contriving the most effectual means
to murder the consul, and set fire to the city. He posted armed men
in convenient places3 was himself always armed; ordered his follow-
ers ιο be so too; was ever pressing them ιο be u n their guard, and
repared for action3 day and night he passed wi out sleep, and in a.
ιιι-ι· ; and yet was unwearied with his never-ceasin toils.

O ' all these measures for war, mussantes, and con agrations, Cicero
received intelligence from Crassus, who, with M. Marcellus and Me·
tellus Scipio, came to his house at midnight, and, having caused him
to be waked, put into his hand a paquet of letters, which had been
lest with Crassus’s porter by a person unknown. Among these let-
ters was one directed ιο Crassus himself, but without the name of
the writer3 the rest were directed to other senators. Crassus opened
his own, and finding in it an exhortation to him ιο quit Rome, because
Catiline was soon to make at havoc there, he immediately carried
all the letters to the consul?¹ who thereupon convened the senate,

. and delivered them, each according to its direction. Being read aloud
ιο the assembly, they were found ιο contajn advices of tlse same im-
ort as those to Crassus3 and it was at this time (the 21st of Octo-
ber), and upon this occasion, that the senate, by a decree, ordered the
consuls ‘⁴ ιο take care that the republic received no detriment.'' Cat·
ilinc, nevertheless, on the sixth of November, summoned the princi-
ffll ἕοηερίηΙιοη ιο meet him in the dead of the night, at the house of

. orcius aeca..

At this meeting it was resolved, that Catiline should put himself at
the head of the troops in Etruria, that Rome should be fired in many
places at once, and a massacre begun at the same time ;‘ that in the

, consternation of the ssre and massacrc, Catiline should be ready, with
his Tuscan army, to take the benefit of the public confusion, and
make himself master of the city3 where Lentulus, in the mean while,
as first in dignity, was to preside in their general councils3 Cassius

Catiline was ve desirous ιο see him taken off before he lest Rome;
