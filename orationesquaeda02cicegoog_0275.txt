mans to be ueath legaeies to distinguished men, and ιι was a reproach
to a man o talents to have no legacy bequeathed him. In reply to
this sarcasm of Antony, Cicero said, he wished that what Anton
said was true, as, in that case, many of his friends, who were dea ,

' would be living3 and then he asserts, that he had received ογ lega·

6. HS ducenties.- H may be considered as 11(i. e. duo) merely
crossedby a horizonta] line; since HVIR, for nouuvm, is found on

ancient coins, and the numeral X is frequently so crossed (Ξ). S

. stands for. semis, kalf. Thus HS (“ two and a half'’) are used as a

the number amounted to decies centena millia sestertifim, ‘⁴ ten hun-

by custom suppressed, leaving decies sestertium, ιο signify ‘⁴ a million

have ado ted the opinion, that decies, in the reckoning of sestertti,
, came to considered as an indeclinable 'substantive noun, in the
singular number, and sestertium as an adjective, agreeing with it in
number and gender, and varying in case as the position of decies in
the sentence might require. Thu ο inion is supported ογ the phrases,
hoc decies, decies plenam, and the lige. The same is true of the nu·
meral adverb· higher than decies. According to this explanation,
HS ducenties in the text is sestertio ducenties, in the ablative, gov-
erned by amplius, and is equivalent to ‘ducenties centem millia ses·
