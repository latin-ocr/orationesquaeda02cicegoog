style that may still be observed, the whole hss received many correc-
tions. Among the additional notes, s few are philological3 but the
most important consist of the Synoptical and Anslyticul Tables of Vo-
ellus. These were first published by Olivet, und, it is believed, heve
never been republished, probably on account of the difficulty of reducing
them to the sive of ο, school-book. They were originally intended for
the help of young studente, and the school-boy recollections of many
persons will donbtless convince them of the necessity of some such nid
for understanding the structure and scope of these most artificinl com-
positione, and for perceiving the relation of ench lesson ιο the general
argument of which it forms s, part. As the Tables consist almost nl-
wuys of the precise words of the text, only differently disposed, they
do not render less necessary ιο the student a. thorough investigation of
the words of his less0n3 and while they encourage diligence, they will
not screen idleness. In these, also, care has been taken ιο conform
the orthography ιο that of the body of the Oratione, and ιο ndapt to the
sections in common use the numbers by which voellus referred to the
now disused divisions of Nizolius.
