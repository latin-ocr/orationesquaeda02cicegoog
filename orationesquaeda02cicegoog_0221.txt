’ Μ. MARCELLth. “ 215'

24. AEmulo at ιιο imitatore .- Marcellus was famous for his forensic ἃ
talenta, and, of a l the orators of his time, seems to have approached
nearest to Cicero in the character of a complete speaker.

31. Offmionibus: While Marcellus was consul, he endeavored to
super-sede Caesar in the command of Gaul 3 he afterwards endeavored
to get Caesar proclaimed Enemy to Ιῖἷῖ country ; in ‘a 1)υέΠο speecl}3 he

were the offences of Marcellae. , μ

33. donibus .· Caesar had entertained suspicions, that Marcel-
lus inten ed to murder him.

1. Fructum....vitoe....lwdierno die.- It should be remembered, that, 63 -

before Cicero had risen to addi-ess Caesar, the whole senate had paid
the tribute due to the merit of Marcellus, by rising, and warmly
ur in the request made for his return.

ἕ. ᾗοὺίίὶεαω .· The family of the Marcelli was of plebeian original,
but, by the hereditary merit of its individuals, had become noble.
Those whose ancestors or themselves had borne any curule magis-
traoy‚ that is, the consulship, the proetorship‚ the censor-ship, or the
office of Curule AEdile, was called nobilem and of the'family of the
Marcelli six had been consuls, of whom one was honored with the
consulship five times, and another three.

14. Pace .· “ Pardon,” or “ permission.”

20. Numero proelz'orum .· Plin informs us, that Caesar had fought
fifty pitched battles, and had s ain 1‚192‚ooo men. If the civil wars
are added ιο the account, says a commentator, this ambitious monster
(Caesu) must have made greater desolation in the world, than any
tyrant, perhaps, that ever lived .— Varietate regionum .· Caesar had
carried on war in Spain, Britain, Gaul, Egy t, German , Asia,
Africa and Greece. He conquered Pompey at harsalia ; tolemy ι
in Egypt3 Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates, in Pontus; Scipio and
Juba in Africa3 and in Spain the sons of Pompey.—Celeritate con-
ficiendi .· Such was the rapidity with which Coesar made some of his ’
conquesta, that, in describing one of them, he said, Veni, vidi, vici.-
“ I came, Ι saw, 1 conquered.’'

34. Hujus glorioe .· The glory of pardoning a man whom he sup-.
posed an enemy-to him. ·

37. Centurio....praefectus, etc. .· The Roman army was formed into
·legioris; each legion was divided into ten cohorts‚ each cohort into
three maniples, and each· maniple into two centuries. There were
also 300 cavalry usually joined to each legion. These were >divided
into ten. turmae, or troops, and each turma into three decuriae, or bodies
of ten men. The centuriones were the officers who commanded the
centuries; the proefecti were appointed to command the allies, and
· seem to have had powers similar to those of the legionary tribunes,
the number of whom was six in each legion, each of whom had under
his command a thousand men.

Ε 43.tiGentes....barbav-as: Gauls, Britons, Germans, Africans, and
gyp ans.

44. Innumerabiles .· It is said that Caesar conquered 400 different
nations in Gaul 3 but these nations probably were but petty tribes,
like those of the savaves of this country.

Q. Sc'millimum Deo Judico: Cicero has been accused of flattery and 64
insincerity in this oration, as well as in that upon the Manilian law.
The only defence and apology we shall offer is extracted from the
writings of his greatest panegyrist. ‘⁴ It should be remembered,”
